#### About

Back in high school, my friends and I got really into game development. Granted, we weren't able to create a finished game, actually far from it. However, we did got to explore many other things. Most importantly, what it takes to develop a game. We found out that **game development is not just about programming.** It takes a lot of planning, discussions, and decision making to create a final product that could potentially be commercialized. Without the proper execution of these processes, the workload would seem really heavy than it actually should be and the development would be a lot more chaotic. 

Throughout the years, my friends and I have grew into very competent developers. We aim to give game development another try and this time, *do it right.* We're planning on starting development this upcoming winter. This repository serves as a documentation of my studies in the Godot Engine since that's where we will create the game.

#### Why Godot?

[Jose](https://github.com/spliteratorrr), a friend of mine, recommended that we use this engine. So far, from what I've read, it's very appropriate since it's very light weight and its development is heavily focused on 2D which is just what we needed. Although we could also develop in more established game engines, I like that we opted for Godot since exploring new stuff is always refreshing. I can't wait to learn more about this engine as the days pass by.
